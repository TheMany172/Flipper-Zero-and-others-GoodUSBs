Repo to collect and create GoodUSB scripts to be run on the Flipper Zero (and other devices that can also run BadUSB or Ducky scripts). The aim being that these scripts will do good rather than evil.

## Planned scripts
- Clean - CClean your device. This will install, run and then remove CCleaner, so you can get the benefits of a clean without the bloat of having the software installed.

As with all scripts - Windows will be the key focus most likely

- MalwareBytes - Scan your device with MalwareBytes. This will install, run and then remove MalwareBytes, so you can get the benefits of a scan without the bloat of having the software installed.

- AntiVirus (maybe Clam?) - Scan your device with an antivirus. This will install, run and then remove the antivirus, so you can get the benefits of a scan without the bloat of having the software installed.

- Cute timeout - load up some cuteness online and have it auto scroll for 15 mins (or however long). Either for a break yourself, or for distracting the kids/pets.

- Voucher-runner - Run through a series of commonly used voucher codes (can be added to all the time) for sites that allow simple keyboard entry, followed by the enter key. I have actually created and used one already that got me 5% off somewhere.

- Scripts from other repos (credited of course)

- Any further ideas as they come :-D
